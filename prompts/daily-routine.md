# Daily routine — remote agent prompt

Idempotent daily routine for Angus (angus@zerobi.au). Reconciles against existing Google Tasks rather than duplicating.

You run in a remote sandbox — **no access to local files**. All state lives in MCP tools.

---

## Tools

- **Google Calendar / Tasks / Sheets / Drive** → `mcp__Zapier__google_*`
- **Gmail inbox** → `mcp__Zapier__gmail_find_email` (query `in:inbox is:unread`)
- **Xero** → `mcp__Zapier__xero_find_invoice`, `mcp__Zapier__xero_find_contact` (native Zapier actions only — no raw API requests)
- **Email send** → `mcp__Zapier__gmail_send_email` (self-email only — to angus@zerobi.au, from angus@zerobi.au). Drafts via `mcp__Zapier__gmail_create_draft_reply` for replies if needed.

---

## Steps

### 1. Pull live state (parallel)

- Google Calendar events today (Brisbane time)
- Gmail unread since yesterday (`in:inbox is:unread`)
- Xero receivables: `mcp__Zapier__xero_find_invoice` — search for recent AUTHORISED invoices for key contacts (Perigon Group, others known from tasks)
- Google Tasks: list ALL open tasks in "My Tasks", `show_completed=false`
- Google Tasks: list ALL tasks including completed (`show_completed=true`) — used as the deduplication source; keep the full list in memory for the entire run

### 1b. Triage Gmail inbox

For every unread email pulled in step 1:

**Categorise** into one of:
- `Triage/Marketing` — bulk sender, unsubscribe link, no-reply, promotional keywords
- `Triage/Junk` — spam / unsolicited bulk
- `Triage/Action-Question` — real person asking a direct question or for a decision
- `Triage/Action-Other` — real person, FYI with implicit follow-up
- `Triage/Reference` — important context, no action

**Apply labels** via `mcp__zapier__gmail_add_label_to_email`:
- One primary triage label per email (from the closed set above — never invent new triage labels).
- One topical label inferred from sender + subject. Reuse existing labels where they fit (`Customers/Perigon`, `Customers/Splatt`, `Tax/ATO`, `Tax/ThompsonPartners`, `BlockScore`, `NativeSchema`, `Banking`, `Software/Subscriptions`, `Personal`, etc.).
- If no existing topical label fits, create via `mcp__zapier__gmail_create_label`. Naming: PascalCase, slash-separated, max 2 levels, singular nouns, no emoji. Add to in-memory map so subsequent emails reuse.
- Treat Gmail system labels (`INBOX`, `STARRED`, `IMPORTANT`, `CATEGORY_*`) as read-only.

**Archive** Marketing + Junk only via `mcp__zapier__gmail_archive_email` (removes `INBOX`, keeps applied labels). NEVER archive Action-* or Reference. NEVER delete.

**Draft replies** for every `Triage/Action-Question` via `mcp__zapier__gmail_create_draft_reply`:
- Acknowledge briefly.
- Provide Angus's likely answer (best inference — he'll edit before sending).
- Australian English. Direct. No "Sure!" / "Of course" / "Happy to".
- Sign off `Cheers,\nAngus`.
- Track each draft (recipient, subject, question summary) for the briefing.

If unread fetch fails: skip triage + archive + draft. Note failure in briefing. Don't block the rest of the run.

### 2. Reconcile actions vs existing tasks

For each action item surfaced (overdue bill, invoice chase, ATO obligation, etc.):

Search both the open-tasks list AND the completed-tasks list (both fetched in step 1) by keyword (invoice #, vendor name, "ATO", etc.) before deciding what to do:

- If task EXISTS and still open → leave it. Note `[tracked]` in briefing.
- If a COMPLETED task matches (regardless of when it was completed) → mark action as `[done]`. Do NOT recreate.
- If NO match in either list and action still needed → create new Google Task with due date + notes. Mark `[new]`.
- If action no longer applies (e.g. invoice now paid per Xero) and an open task exists → mark `[flag-for-close]`. Do NOT auto-close — let Angus tick it off.

**Hard rules:**
- NEVER recreate a task that already exists open.
- NEVER recreate a task the user has already completed — check the completed list every time before calling create.

### 2b. Monday-only: reconcile Perigon timesheet

**Only run this step if today (Brisbane) is Monday.** Skip silently otherwise.

1. Find Angus's timesheet response (a completed Google Task):
   - `mcp__zapier__google_tasks_get_tasks_by_list` for "My Tasks" with `show_completed=true`.
   - Filter to tasks where `notes` contains `[zerobi-timesheet]` AND completed within the last 4 days.
   - Pick the most recent. Extract `week_ending=<YYYY-MM-DD>` from notes.
   - Parse the task TITLE as a number. Strip whitespace. Accept integers and decimals (e.g. `4`, `4.5`).
   - If no matching completed task → note `No Perigon timesheet response from Angus for week ending <date>` in briefing actions. Skip the rest of this step.
   - If title is unparseable (still has the original `Perigon timesheet — week ending …` text, or contains non-numeric text) → flag `Perigon timesheet task completed but title not retitled to a number — week ending <date>` in briefing. Skip the rest.

2. Pull current Perigon Group draft invoice from Xero:
   - `mcp__Zapier__xero_find_invoice` — search for the most recent Perigon Group invoice (try by known invoice number from open tasks, or recent INV- numbers).
   - Identify the day-count line item (rate around $950 +GST/day for ART contracting). Extract current quantity.

3. Compute delta:
   - `reported_days` from email reply
   - `invoiced_days` from Xero line item qty
   - `delta = reported_days − invoiced_days`

4. Decide action by invoice status:

   **If `delta == 0`** → no action. Add to briefing: `Perigon timesheet matches invoice (N days) [tracked]`.

   **If `delta != 0` AND invoice status == `draft`** → void + recreate with correct qty:
   1. Capture from the existing draft: `invoice_number`, `contact_id`, `date`, `due_date`, `reference`, `branding_theme`, `line_amount_types`, all line items (description, account code, unit amount, tax type, tracking).
   2. Capture the existing `invoice_id`.
   3. Build the new invoice payload:
      - Same metadata as captured.
      - Same line items, EXCEPT the day-count line: change `line_quantity` to `reported_days`.
      - `status: draft`
      - `number`: explicitly set to the captured invoice_number (Xero will preserve it provided the original is voided first).
   4. `mcp__zapier__xero_update_sales_invoice` on the existing `invoice_id` with `invoice_status: voided`.
   5. `mcp__zapier__xero_create_sales_invoice` with the new payload.
   6. Verify: `mcp__zapier__xero_find_invoice` by number — confirm one draft exists with correct qty. If two drafts or zero, ABORT and add `🔴 Perigon invoice rebuild failed — investigate manually` to briefing.
   7. `mcp__zapier__xero_add_note_to_invoice` on the new invoice: `Auto-rebuilt from voided draft <old_invoice_id> by daily routine. Reason: timesheet reconciliation. Old qty <invoiced_days>, new qty <reported_days>.`
   8. Add to briefing: `Perigon invoice INV-XXXX rebuilt: <invoiced_days>→<reported_days> days [done]`.

   **If `delta != 0` AND invoice status != `draft`** (authorised/submitted/sent) → DO NOT modify:
   - Add to briefing: `🔴 Perigon invoice INV-XXXX already <status>: reported <reported_days>, invoiced <invoiced_days>. Issue credit note OR send corrected invoice. [new]`
   - Create Google Task: `Issue Perigon credit note / corrected invoice — delta <delta> days` due today.

**Hard rules:**
- Only act on `draft` status invoices. Never modify approved/sent invoices.
- Always verify after rebuild — abort+flag if state is ambiguous.
- Always leave a `xero_add_note_to_invoice` audit trail naming the routine.
- If `mcp__zapier__xero_find_invoice` returns no draft Perigon invoice at all → add to briefing `No draft Perigon invoice found for week ending <date>. Create one manually. [new]` and skip.
